I have to say the place was awesome#anecdotes/miscellaneous
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin#food
#
We requested they re-slice the sushi and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes#food
The service however is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders) and the clientele for the most part are rowdy loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game#service
